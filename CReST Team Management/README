CReST: Team Manager

## Overview
This application is designed for small internal teams or startup projects, providing a secure platform for managing team members and internal resources. It allows each team member to register, manage their profile details (such as username, email, and role), and ensures that passwords are securely stored using strong hashing algorithms.

For startups with a team of developers, designers, marketers, or other staff, the app offers a flexible way to handle user roles. Admins can manage user permissions and restrict access to specific sections of the app based on roles, ensuring that sensitive information and internal resources are protected.

The app is ideal for small teams looking to streamline user management while ensuring robust security practices, all in a user-friendly environment.
